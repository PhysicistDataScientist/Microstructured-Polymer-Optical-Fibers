# Welcome to experiments on mPOFs!

In this repository you will find scientific work involving microstructured polymer optical fibers.

In the folder "General" you will find a manual to pull mPOFs using a drawing tower named "Manual.pdf". 
Also, you can check the "Technical Drawing Pulling.pdf" and "Technical Drawing Workshop.pdf". 
They are the technical drawings having the design of holes for a sample. 
The first helps me during the pulling process and the second is to create the preform.

Additionally, I uploaded an Excel sheet related to the control of the samples on the drying chambers named "Samples Drying Chamber.xlsx".
To modify the archive "Samples Drying Chamber.xlsx" I created a python file "Samples Control.py", which I execute every time a change is made on a sample.
The Excel sheet may be in the same folder and you need to pass the folder location to the file "Sample Path Manager.txt".
"Sample Path Manager.txt" shall be in the same folder as "Samples Control.py".

To help with the analysis of the pulling process, I uploaded to the folder "Pulling Analyser" a Python code named "Pulling Analyser.py".
In the file "Pulling Path Manager.txt" you shall pass the path location of the pulling data folder.
This file should be in the same folder as "Pulling Analyser.py".

There is one folder "E - 21" with example of different pulling bands ("Data Pulling Band A.txt", "Data Pulling Band B.txt" and "Data Pulling Band C.txt").
You need to pass the location to "Pulling Path Manager.txt" in which will contains the folder "E - 21".

A report on the pulling results of the sample "E - 21" was elaborated and is available inside its folder as "Report.pdf".

A scientific paper about this fabrication process was published: Eduardo A. V. Souza, Cristiano M. B. Cordeiro, "Developing Microstructured Polymer Optical Fibers
for Sensing Applications". LAWOFS 2024.
