# Welcome to experiments on mPOFs!

In this repository you will find scientific work involving microstructured polymer optical fibers.

A manual to pull mPOFs using a drawing tower was elaborated and can be encountered here as "Manual.pdf".

Additionally, I submited the Excel sheets related to the control of the samples and their specifications.
The control of samples on the drying chamber is made by using "Samples Drying Chamber.xlsx".
The specification of each group of sample are in "Samples Group Specifications.xlsx".

To modify the archive "Samples Drying Chamber Control.xlsx" I created a python file "Samples Control.py", which I execute every time a change is made on a sample.
Also, this code relate the samples specifications from "Samples Group Specifications.xlsx".

To help with the analysis of the pulling process, I developed a Python code named "Pulling Control.py".
In the file "Pulling Path Manager.txt" you shall pass the path location of the pulling data folder.
There is one folder "E - 21" with example of different pulling bands ("Data Pulling Band A.txt", "Data Pulling Band B.txt" and "Data Pulling Band C.txt").
So, you need to pass the folder location which will contains the folder "E - 21".

A report on the pulling of the sample "E - 21" was elaborated and is available inside its folder as "Report.pdf".

A scientific paper about this fabrication process was published:
