# Welcome to experiments on mPOFs!

In this repository you will find scientific researchs involving microstructured polymer optical fibers.

A manual to pull mPOFs using a drawing tower was elaborated and can be encountered here as "Manual.pdf".

Additionally, I submited the Excel sheets related to the control of the samples and their specifications.
The control of samples on the drying chamber is made by using "Samples Drying Chamber Control.xlsx".
The specification of each group of sample are in "Samples Group Specifications.xlsx".
To modify the archive "Samples Drying Chamber Control.xlsx" I created a python file, which I execute every time a change is made on a sample.
Also, this code relate the samples specifications from "Samples Group Specifications.xlsx".

To help with the analysis of the pulling process, I developed a Python code named ""
